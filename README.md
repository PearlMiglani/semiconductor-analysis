# **Semiconductor Industry Classification Using Machine Learning**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements **industry classification** using a **scikit-learn pipeline** that includes data preprocessing steps. Multiple classifiers are implemented for comparison to determine the best-performing model.  

### **Implemented Classifiers**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Achieves **93% accuracy**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier** – Achieves **100% accuracy**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Achieves **93% accuracy**  
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** – Achieves **99% accuracy**  

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
The model performance is evaluated using:  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts.  
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.  
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the overall accuracy of the model.  

### **Data Description**  
- **Rank**: The rank of the company based on market capitalization.  
- **Market Cap (USD)**: The market capitalization of the company in USD.  
- **Country**: The country where the company is based.  
- **Industry**: The industry of the company.  
- **Sector**: The target variable, representing the sector of the company.  

### **Model Implementation**  
The project follows a structured scikit-learn pipeline for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
